Angular's dependency injection feature

NOTE: Dependency Injection is pervasive throughout Angular.

- Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that deals with how components get hold of their dependencies
  (Angular injector subsystem is in charge of creating components, resolving their dependencies, and providing them to other components as requested)

Things that can be injected in Angular:
	1. Components (injected with service and value)
		- Services
		- Directives
		- Filters
		- Animations
	2. Controllers (injected with service and value - can also be injected as special dependency)
		-
