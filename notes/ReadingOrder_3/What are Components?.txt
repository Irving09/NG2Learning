Component
	- How we structure and reason about our entire Angular UI
	- An entire Angular Application is just A TREE OF COMPONENTS

This whole thing is a Component, two main things, Component annotation (@Component) and Component controller (a class in ES6 ==> TodoApp)

@Component({
	...
	...
})

class TodoApp {
	...
	...
}

@Component - This describes what our component actually is, where your component gets wired up in the html
Example)

	@Component({
		selector: 'todo-app',			===> Actual HTML tag that will be attached to this component
		template: new TemplateConfig({	===> This is where your component actuall lives
			url: 'todos.html'
		})
	});

Component Controller (TodoApp) - The controller is what your template reads from

class TodoApp {
	constructor() {
		...
	}
}
