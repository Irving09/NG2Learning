Angular Testing

- Dependency injection for xhr requests can be mocked
- Provides abstractions which allow you to test your model
  without having to resort to manipulating the DOM.
- Angular comes with dependency injection built-in,
  because you can pass in a component's dependencies and stub or mock them
- Components that have their dependencies injected allow them
  - to be easily mocked on a test by test bases.
