NOTE:
	- AtScript is NOT a language to replace Javascript
	- AtScript is merely syntactical sugar on top of ES6
	- It works with TypeScript, V8, and others on proposals for TC39 standards committe. AtScript compiles to ES5

In 2014, the Angular team anounced its ECMAScript language extension called,
AtScript, which adds types and annotations to the Javascript language.

Annotations
	- AtScript comes with Type Annotations, Field Annotations and Metadata Annotations

Example 1.)
	Metadata Annotation (@Component and @View)

	@Component({
		selector: 'tabs'
	})
	@View({
		templateUrl : 'src/components/app/app.html'
	})
	export class Tabs {
		
	}

In Example 1)
	- You have a class called Tabs that is basically empty.
	- It has two annotations (@Component, @View)
	- @Component is an annotation that tells Angular,
	  that the class 'Tabs' is a component
	- @View gives Angular information about the view of the component.
	  In this case, it is an html file located from the root of the project,
	  into "src/components/app"

NOTE:
	- If we had removed all annotations, what would be left is just an empty class
	  that doesnt have special meaning. This is what annotations are all about.
	  They are a declarative way to add metadata to code.

Questions?
	- Where do those annotations come from?
		import { Component, View } from 'angular2/angular2';

	- Who defined that those annotations are called @Component and @View?

	- What do these annotations translate to so we can use it to today's browsers?
